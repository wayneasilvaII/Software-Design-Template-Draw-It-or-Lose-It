Who was the client?
The client was The Gaming Roomg

What type of software did they want you to design?
They wanted me to design a web-based game similar to hangman except the user has to guess what an image is that is slowly rendered to the screen.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation
While developing this documentation I think that I effectively captured the needs of the client in the requirements, design constrains, and UML diagram section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document was very helpful in developing my code. Specifically, when creating the UML diagram section I was really able to visualize and conceptualize the relationships
between each class in the class hierarchy. This made it much easier to begin writing code that was concise and purposeful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would work on the recommendations sections. My reasoning is, while I fully agree with my choice of operating platform, I think that I could have continued further in my explanations to better make my case.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully listened to the client, considering their needs as explicitly outlined. Additionally, I tried to think of edge case, requirements, and conditionals that would need to be addressed that the client perhaps could miss.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design by trying to really understand the class hierarchy and relationships between components.
